# Stargazer

The backend side of Starlight. *Maybe* it is blazingly-fast ðŸš€ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Completely rewritten from scratch pursuing feature parity
from [its C# counterpart](https://github.com/starlight-the-game/starlight/tree/c317231d213dad168ffb18388db17ef227490cd3/Starlight.Backend).

## Requirements

- Rust, of course.
- MSRV is `Rust 1.85.1`.

## Note

- We do use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
  and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (*for now*).
