# Stargazer

The backend side of Starlight. Completely rewritten from scratch from its C# counterpart. *Maybe* it is blazingly-fast ðŸš€ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

## Requirements

- Rust, of course.
- MSRV is `Rust 1.85.1`.
    - I wrote the code on GNU ABI *so far*, so saved you a hassle of installing VS Build Tools. 

## Note

- We do use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (*for now*).
